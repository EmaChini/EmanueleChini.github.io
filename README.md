#### Reactive Synthesis for Expected Impacts
- **Abstract**: "As business processes become increasingly complex, effectively modeling decision points, their likelihood,and resource consumption is crucial for optimizing operations. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a formal extension of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) that incorporates choices, probabilities, and impacts, referred to as *CPI*. This extension is motivated by the growing emphasis on precise control within business process management, where carefully selecting decision pathways in repeated instances  is crucial for conforming to certain standards of multiple resource consumption and environmental impacts. In this context we deal with the problem of synthesizing a strategy (if any) that guarantees that the expected impacts on repeated execution of the input process are below a given threshold.  We show that this problem belongs to PSPACE complexity class; moreover we provide an effective procedure for computing a strategy (if present)."

#### A migration framework for active BPMN processes in healthcare
- **Abstract**: "The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a diagrammatical notation to describe complex process models,
and it can be used as a common language among stakeholders. These stakeholders could intervene in the development of the processes, also in an agile environment. Thus, the same process could evolve through different versions over time. BPMN has been already adopted in the healthcare domain, where designing healthcare processes is fundamental for delivering optimal and efficient services to patients without overburdening healthcare professionals. Adapting and updating BPMN processes within an agile development is paramount in the rapidly evolving healthcare domain. The challenges of migrating a process to its revised versions have been discussed since the introduction of BPMN. However, there is a lack of migration policies that consider compensation strategies when migrating to a revised version at runtime, combined with healthcare-related migration risk classes.
In this paper, we propose a methodological framework that includes migration strategies to adopt when the user is already running the process in a previous version. We propose compensatory strategies to integrate the novelties of the revised process based on the actual users‚Äô completion status, with a specific focus on the addition, modification, and removal of tasks. Moreover, the proposed framework includes a color-coded risk classification system encapsulating migration risks and potential impact on patients. This system provides a visual and intuitive way to understand potential risks, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions about the migration strategy. Finally, we showed an application of the proposed framework in a real-world scenario, that is, through an ERAS-inspired prehabilitation program for pancreatic surgery currently developed at the Verona Pancreas Institute."
